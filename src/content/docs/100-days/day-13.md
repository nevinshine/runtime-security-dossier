- Reviewed Sentinel Sandbox architecture and recent experiments
- Validated previous results and logs
- Identified no new implementation work for the day

**Reason:**  
Heavy research and debugging in prior days required a recovery window to avoid rushed or low-quality work.

**Status:** Completed (No new code changes)
