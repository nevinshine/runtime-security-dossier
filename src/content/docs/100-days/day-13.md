### Overview

Today was intentionally kept free of new implementation work.

Following several days of intensive kernel-level tracing, feature engineering, anomaly scoring, and documentation, a recovery window was necessary to avoid rushed or low-quality additions.

### Activities
- Reviewed Sentinel Sandbox architecture
- Re-validated recent anomaly detection experiments
- Ensured research logs and code state were consistent
- No new code or experiments introduced

### Rationale
Sustainable research progress requires periodic consolidation.  
This day serves as a **checkpoint**, not a gap.

### Status
**Completed** — No new changes
